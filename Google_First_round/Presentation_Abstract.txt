Echo State Networks(ESNs) to address Caching and Mobility challenges in Information Centric Networks(ICNs)

Abstract: ICNs reffered as the etire class of internet architectures that focus on content/data
as the central entity as opposed to a host-centric networking architecture. This is the emerging 
technology is the key to high speed (5G) internet. Though this architecture overcome most of the 
limitations of conventional host-centric networking, it still have some challenges to address. 
Some of these challenges include proactive caching and service continuity (Mobility issues) for mobile users. 
Echo State Networks(ESNs) are the recurrent neural networks used to predict user request content distribution 
and user mobilities to cluster the users and extract the most useful content to keep in the caches. This solution
already proposed to solve caching issues in cloud radio access networks and this can solution also applied to address other problems.  
Tomorrow I am going to present about how the ESNs works and how this can by applied to get better performance to address mobility issue mentioned in 
Responsive content-centric delivery in large urban communication networks: a Link-NYC use-case.
